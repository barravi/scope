// Report is the core data type. It's produced by probes, and consumed and
// stored by apps. It's composed of multiple topologies, each representing
// a different (related, but not equivalent) view of the network.
type Report struct {
	// Endpoint nodes are individual (address, port) tuples on each host.
	// They come from inspecting active connections and can (theoretically)
	// be traced back to a process. Edges are present.
	Endpoint Topology

	// Address nodes are addresses (e.g. ifconfig) on each host. Certain
	// information may be present in this topology that can't be mapped to
	// endpoints (e.g. ICMP). Edges are present.
	Address Topology

	// Process nodes are processes on each host. Edges are not present.
	Process Topology

	// Container nodes represent all Docker containers on hosts running probes.
	// Metadata includes things like containter id, name, image id etc.
	// Edges are not present.
	Container Topology

	// ContainerImages nodes represent all Docker containers images on
	// hosts running probes. Metadata includes things like image id, name etc.
	// Edges are not present.
	ContainerImage Topology

	// Host nodes are physical hosts that run probes. Metadata includes things
	// like operating system, load, etc. The information is scraped by the
	// probes with each published report. Edges are not present.
	Host Topology

	// Overlay nodes are active peers in any software-defined network that's
	// overlaid on the infrastructure. The information is scraped by polling
	// their status endpoints. Edges could be present, but aren't currently.
	Overlay Topology

	// Sampling data for this report, which (at the moment) comes from the
	// sniffer module. If there's no packets sniffed, there's no samling
	// information, and the effective sample rate is 1.0.

	// Window is the amount of time covered by the report. It's necessary to
	// calculate rates. In practice, probes set it to their publish interval,
	// and apps set it on the uber-report they generate based on the delta of
	// the oldest and newest report.
